# This is an example of robot model for the Robocup Virtual Humanoid League
# It is derived from the Darwin-opHinge2.proto included in Webots
# You shoud implement the same interface in your own robots, including the
# translation, rotation, name and controllerArgs fields, so that they can
# be properly inserted into Robocup games.
